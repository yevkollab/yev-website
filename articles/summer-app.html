                I (almost) finished my first app! It was surprisingly not that simple for me and while app is going through apple review I want to document my process in this article.
            </p>

            <h2>Idea</h2>
            <p>
                Ideation were somehow the hardest part for me. Usually I like when things are going organically, like 'I had a problem - I solved it - turns out other people have the same problem' or when I started my first company I didn't think twice about is it good or do I be able to do it, I just had a feeling 'alright it will be fun and I want to do it now'
            </p>
            <p>
                The things a little different now since I don't have a clear quest yet and don't know what I wanna do with life except 'would be cool to build successful b2c startup'
            </p>
            <p>
                So, idea search took me more than 2 weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with the things I like the most, than I tried research the thigs I know a lot about, and in the end I stopped in not so popular niche with 2 competitors (one of those a famous twitter influencer)
            </p>
            <p>
                I know nothing about this niche but the numbers and competitors tells me I have quite a good chances to earn some mrr next couple of month.
            </p>
            <p>
                Idk, I always choose things I like rather than good numbers, but nothing bad will be out of just trying something new?
            </p>

            <h2>Design UI and UX</h2>
            <p>
                The most enjoyable phase of building for me is always design. Took me 2 weeks to design 21 screens include onboarding. (will share some soon!)
            </p>
            <p>
                My design process is:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Research (UX)</li>
                <li>Feature list</li>
                <li>Wireframe in Figma</li>
                <li>UI</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                While UI is straightforward - approach to research changed for me this year chat did a good job to help me understand my users, like,
            </p>
            <p>
                what they do<br>
                what their value<br>
                what they like<br>
                etc
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I have no idea about the niche, it was awesome starting point. Second source was a reddit, which is also good to study the audience and what they like.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the UX research I just write down the features and designed everything else in Figma
            </p>

            <h2>Code</h2>
            <p>
                It compiles
            </p>

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>
                One good thing about being not in the hurry - I don't have a high expectation that my first ios app will achieve the 10k mrr. I have quite a lot time to do exactly same process time and time again which I sure will be doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                You see, I reflected a lot on my past experience and I have a feeling that it will be really hard for me to be employed because I spent 5 years building my own business - I need at least 10k/month but I'm not sure I can do something useful for other (I can do everything at the okay level)
            </p>
            <p>
                This makes me very bad candidate for employment (I don't even know the position I potentially can apply)
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I need to be better in sales and English to achieve 10k and with working app in the apple store I will now have a great opportunity to study both the same time.
